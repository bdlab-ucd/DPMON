<h1 align="center"> Learning from Multi-omics Networks to Enhance Disease Prediction using Graph Neural Networks </h1>

## Introduction
## Dataset Description
## Methodology
This repository contains the code for a multi-omics data integration pipeline that leverages graph neural networks for enhanced phenotype prediction. The pipeline consists of four main components:
1)	Graph Neural Network (GNN) for Feature Embeddings: Extracts informative node embeddings from the graph using a graph neural network architecture (e.g., GCN, GAT). 
3)	Dimensionality Reduction of the Embeddings: Reduces the dimensionality of the embedding space to address computational inefficiencies. 
4)	Integration of the Embeddings into the Multi-omics Dataset: Integrates the generated embeddings with the raw multi-omics data using specific techniques (e.g., concatenation, scaling).
5)	Neural Network for Phenotype Prediction: Trains a neural network to predict the phenotype based on the integrated data.
This pipeline is trained end-to-end, optimizing all components simultaneously.
